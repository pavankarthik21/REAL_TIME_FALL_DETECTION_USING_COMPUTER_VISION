# ----- THIS IS MY RESEARCH INTERNSHIP PROJECT AT IIT HYDERABAD ------------------

Developed and implemented a robust fall detection algorithm leveraging background subtraction, contour detection, and bounding box calculation methodologies to accurately identify instances of falling with precision and efficiency.

Achieved a remarkable 93\% accuracy in detecting potential falls of individuals through meticulous analysis of video footage using advanced image processing techniques and Computer Vision libraries(OpenCV).

Demonstrated expertise in data visualization by generating real-time visual feedback, including bounding box overlays and dynamic plot displays, to facilitate comprehensive analysis and interpretation of fall detection results.
